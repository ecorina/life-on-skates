      <h3>Short Description:</h3>

      <p class="moreInfo">
        <em
          >Inline skates are a type of roller skate used for inline skating.
          Unlike quad skates, which have two front and two rear wheels, inline
          skates typically have two to five wheels arranged in a single line.
          Some, especially those for recreation, have a rubber "stop" or "brake"
          block attached to the rear of one or occasionally both of the skates
          so that the skater can slow down or stop by leaning back on the foot
          with the brake skate.

      <p class="history">
        John Joseph Merlin experimented with single- to many-rowed devices worn
        on feet in 1760. Inline skates, skates designed to work like ice skates
        during periods of warm weather, was patented by Robert John Tyers of
        London in 1823, his Rolito design featured brass wheels. Louis Legrange
        of France created an inline design in 1849. Legrange designed the skates
        for an opera where a character was to appear to be skating on ice. The
        skates were problematic and unsuccessful as the wearer could not turn
        nor could they stop. At some point between 1895 and 1899 the UK
        engineering company D. Napier & Son made Ritter "road skates", which had
        two comparatively large wheels, front and back, on each skate...
